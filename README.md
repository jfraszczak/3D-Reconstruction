# 3D-Reconstruction

Project for Computer Vision and Image Analysis course at Politecnico di Milano.

Goal of the project was a 3D reconstruction of a human shape from images taken from different angles. Due to 
the presence of specific landmarks like visible rectangular markers and the fact that human body is covered by
flexible costume with multiple crossing lines it is possible to exploit geometrical properties in order to 
reconstruct mentioned shape.
